## About Adobe Fuse
Adobe Fuse revolutionized 3D character creation by making it accessible to artists and designers without specialized 3D modeling expertise.

Fuse's real-time preview and instant feedback system allows creators to visualize their characters from any angle while making adjustments, streamlining the character development process for games, animations, and visual presentations.

The desktop application delivers powerful character creation tools for both macOS and Windows platforms, featuring a massive library of mix-and-match components that can be combined to create virtually unlimited character variations. With support for custom content creation and community-shared assets, Fuse enables artists to expand their creative possibilities beyond the built-in library.
